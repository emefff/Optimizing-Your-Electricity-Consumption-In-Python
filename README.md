# Optimizing-Your-Electricity-Consumption-In-Python
The title is a bit click-baity, but generally, the base software for optimization of your power consumption can be written within 10 hours, even by a non-professional. Such an example is shown here. It is still work in progress, thus nearly nothing is commented or described in detail in the code.
First we generate a zero-profile for one day on a minute basis (thus 1440 zeros). Thus, one minute os our smallest unit of time. The problem is, that different power meters have different measuring intervals in Home Assistant (Shelly seems to have a dynamic interval down to a few seconds, AVM Fritz power meters are sometimes a bit dynamic but mostly they deliver 2 minute intervals. Others may be again different, IDK). 
However, we have to define a power curve for every appliance we want to include in our 'simulation'. Due to the minute interval, these curves are lists with power values (positive if we consume that power, negative if we generate it from our solar array) in one minute intervals, thus we have to flatten shorter spikes to a one-minute-average. Some power profiles are included in the code. In the future we will probably implement a file with these values to unclutter the Python file.
Our main function in this software is inject_power_value. As the name suggests, it 'injects' a power value from a device at the given 'running' (absolute) time of day. We can switch a device on by giving the inject_power_value function a 'device' that is a tiny list like coffemaker_1 = ["07:00", "09:00", coffemaker_profile_1] with a starting time and an end time plus a power profile of this device. That's all. The inject_power_value function writes and accumulates a power value to a global total_power_curve_per_day list. It's really that simple.
The shared code starts with a lot of number (the power profiles for a few devices). The main program first calculates a typical power curve of a typical sunny day in home office where we switch on the boiler for hot water early in the morning (night rather :-) ), we get up sometime at 6:30 or so and switch on the news and the coffeemaker from 07:00 to 09:00. This day is also a laundry day, plus the dishwasher needs to be switched on too. For this day we get a simulated power curve like:

As we can see, there's quite a lot going on with some spiky power values from the coffemaker, laundry machine and dishwasher (please refer to the code for details, it's all there). We find the total energy consumed to be 5.304 kWh.
The curve shown also shows negative values from the solar array. The total power consumed value does not include negative values, negative values are set to zero (in small solar arrays in EU, this energy is lost to the user!). This is very important for the optimization. Many readers will already have at least a tiny solar array (commonly referred to as 'Balkonkraftwerk' in the DACH region). So what is this little simulation even good for, if we, as solar array owners already know what to do for energy optimization ('start all appliances during solar hours' is what we need to do)? 
Of course we can investigate our usage in much greater detail and simulate (profiles needed must be available, of course!) for example, in a first step an optimum start time for the laundry machine. In the code, we just brute-force (minute by minute during a given interval of 5-16 o' clock, that's 5AM to 4PM for all Americans) and scan through a lot of energy values to find the optimum. The result after this first optimization looks like this:
